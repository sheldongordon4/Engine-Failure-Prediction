# Engine Failure Prediction â€“ RUL Estimation with NASA CMAPSS

This project uses machine learning to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines based on NASAâ€™s CMAPSS dataset. The system is designed to enable predictive maintenance, helping engineers and technicians prevent failure, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance planning.

## Project Highlights
- **Data-Driven Maintenance**
Uses real-world engine data to forecast failures before they happen.
- **ML Model Trained for RUL Prediction**
Compares Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, and LightGBM â€” with LightGBM selected for its superior performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - **MAE**: 18.01
  - **RMSE**: 24.31
- **Deployed with Streamlit**
A real-time dashboard for monitoring engine health and predicting risk.

## Dataset Description
NASA CMAPSS dataset from Kaggle includes:
- **Train Set**: Full run-to-failure history for 100 engines
- **Test Set**: Partial lifecycle up to a cut-off point
- **RUL File**: Ground truth for Remaining Useful Life

Each entry contains:
- Engine ID
- Cycle number
- 3 operational settings
- 21 sensor readings

## Feature Engineering

- Constructed RUL as `RUL = EOL - cycle_time`
- Dropped low-variance sensors
- Selected sensors showing degradation trends
- Applied `StandardScaler` for normalization
- Ensured feature consistency across train/test sets

## Model Development

Tested three regression models:
| Model                  | RMSE |
|------------------------|------|
| Support Vector Regressor | 33.31 |
| Random Forest Regressor  | 31.74 |
| **LightGBM**              | **31.32** (selected) |

âœ… LightGBM was selected for its speed, accuracy, and built-in feature importance insights.

## Maintenance Use Case

The system classifies engine health based on RUL:

| Predicted RUL  | Maintenance Action       |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| â‰¤ 15 cycles    | Immediate Repair         |
| 16â€“47 cycles   | Schedule Inspection      |
| > 47 cycles    | Continue Normal Operation|

This enables:
- Proactive failure prevention  
- Cost-optimized maintenance planning  
- Improved equipment safety

```bash
streamlit run monitor_engine.py
```

Features:

- Real-time RUL prediction
